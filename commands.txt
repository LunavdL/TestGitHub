These are useful git commands:

cd RepositoryName # first make sure you are in the directory you want to work in
git pull # update the repository it to make sure there are no new version on GitHub
git echo "this is what I want to copy to a document" >> document.txt # this creates document.txt and adds text
git add --all :/ # this is how you add everything to staged documents
git commit -m "I did this" # here you commit it the documents with a useful comment on what you changed
git push # now you push it to the cloud

git checkout HEAD~1 # check the previous state

# in case of a merge conflict (when one person forgot to pull and is actually working in an older version of the document)
